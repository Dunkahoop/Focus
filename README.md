# Focus

This extension will limit the tabs in your browser to one. This is useful if you struggle to maintain focus when working and you need your browser open, as attempting to open a distracting page will lead to the loss of a tab you likely need for your work.

This extension does not prevent you from creating another broswer window, or prevent you from dragging and dropping windows, which creates two tabs, but with this extension it's much more unintuitive to have multiple tabs open, which should be a good deterrent.

This should work with any chromium-based browser (Chrome(duh...), Edge, Opera, Brave, etc.) and uses Manifest V3, so it should work into June 2024. I tried to get it to work for both Firefox and Chromuim browsers, but it didn't work out very well. I may do that one day, but since most netizens use a Chromium browser it's not a top priority.

This is not a one-size-fits-all solution for minimizing distractions, and this extension may not work for you if multiple tabs are need, and there are other options out there like [Tab Limiter](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tab-limiter/pbpfchnddjilendkobiabenojlniemoh). This is good for if you need only one tab and you want to make sure you don't get distracted with anything else.

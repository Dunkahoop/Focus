# Focus

This extension will limit your browser to show only one webpage. This is useful if you struggle to maintain focus when working and you need your browser open, as attempting to open another page will lead to the loss of a page you likely need for your work.

This should work with any chromium-based browser (Chrome(duh...), Edge, Opera, Brave, etc.) and uses Manifest V3, so it should work into June 2024. I tried to get it to work for both Firefox and Chromium browsers, but it didn't work out very well. I may do that one day, but since most netizens use a Chromium browser (and Firefox supports Chromium extensions) it's not a top priority.

This is not a one-size-fits-all solution for minimizing distractions, and this extension may not work for you if multiple webpages are needed, and there are other options out there like [Tab Limiter](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tab-limiter/pbpfchnddjilendkobiabenojlniemoh). This is good for if you need only one webpage open and you want to make sure you don't get distracted with anything else.

UPDATE 26th May 2024: I decided to automatically close the previously open window when the user opens a new window. This also prevents the user from dragging and dropping tabs into windows, since they can't be created.
